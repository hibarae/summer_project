# Flutter OPUS
This is a responsive flutter app that uses a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device to detect when someone has fallen.
Upon detection, this application will alert an emergency contact (via SMS) the location of the person who has fallen.

This project was built for the [Smart Communities and IoT Lab](https://www.kent.edu/cs/research-labs) (SCI Lab) at [Kent State University](https://www.kent.edu/cs) in collaboration with [Dr. Jungyoon Kim](https://www.kent.edu/cs/jungyoon-kim).
